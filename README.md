# Multivariate Kalman Filter

   The Kalman Filter is a linear quadratic estimator used to predict the state of a multi-variate system, while accounting for both noise and hidden variables. The filter functions in primarily two steps, the prediction step and the correction step. Run recursively, the algorithm functions in real time, using only the present inputs and previously calculated states.

   I coded this implementation as a proof-of-concept while interning for the Brozik Group (Physical Chemistry, Washington State University). I later modified a version of this script to be used in a novel confocal microscope to track stochastic hindered diffusion of Aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) proteins.
