Multivariate Kalman Filter

The Kalman Filter is a statistical device used to predict the state of a multi-variate system, while accounting for both noise and hidden variables. The filter functions in primarily two steps, the prediction step and the correction step. Run recursively, the algorithm functions in real time, using only the present inputs and previously calculated states.
